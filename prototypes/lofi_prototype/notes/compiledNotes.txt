Worst: 
- Message/requests doesn't make sense
  - merge them into one
  - have a filter on top for swapping between two

Moderate:
- All/suggest/connected
  - change to filter on location/time/recent
- What if your top suggested is someone you already know
  - Add an "I already know this person" button
  - This dismisses them from your feed.
- What if I don't want to talk to this person
  - Add an accept and dismiss button
  - Add a dialog box to accept or decline a new message.
  - Let user see message, instead of chat box, have accept or decline buttons
    - If accept, chat box comes back
    - If decline, their message request goes away.

Mild:
- on messages, how to get to profile
  - current: click on name
  - future: add a small profile button
- Put a list of profiles in side bar
  - if we want to, easy way for people to see their contacts
- Still hard to send out a first message
  - Add an option to send out a prompt instead of a message
- Didn't think to open profile to see where user saw that person
  - Add it to the snippit on the main screen
- App looks a lot like things that already exist
  - ???
